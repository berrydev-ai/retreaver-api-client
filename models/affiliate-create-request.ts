/**
 * Retreaver Core API
 * The Retreaver Core API can be used to automate core business processes, like changing where calls are routed, and many other features that would normally be accessed through our account portal.  **Authentication**: All requests require an API key passed as a query parameter `api_key`. If you have access to multiple companies, also pass `company_id`.  **Format**: The API supports both JSON and XML. Use `.json` or `.xml` file extensions in the URL and set the appropriate Content-Type header.  **Pagination**: Returns 25 results per page. Use the Link HTTP header to navigate pages.  **Security Warning**: Never expose your API key publicly as it can be used to access your entire Retreaver account without restriction!
